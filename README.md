# arxiv_pdf_downloader
this python script helps you download designated arxiv pdf files and automatically renames the downloaded file.

Enter the arxiv no (e.g.,
1. yymm.nnnnn
2. nnnnn, or the last non zero digits.
3. the full url: http(s)://arxiv.org/pdf/abcd.nnnnn(.pdf)

)

and wait for it being done for you.
